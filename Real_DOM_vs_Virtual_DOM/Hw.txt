Find out difference between Real and Virtual DOM.
: DOM=Document Object Model
: BOM=BROWSER OBJECT Model
: WOM=WINDOWS OBJECT Model

: selector: document.getElementByID()
	:document.getElementByTagName()
	:document.getElementByClassName()
	:document.querySelector("#ID_name")
	:document.querySelectorAll("");

:DOM is nothing but whaterever comes under the margin of document screen it's DOM screen 
: where we are displays all the things in that section 
: There are three types of module: 1.WOM (WINDOW OBJECT MODULE) 2.BOM (BROWSER OBJECT MODULE) 3.DOM(DOCUMENT OBJECT MODULE)

: IN REACT THRE ARE SOME IMPORTANT : API'S OR COMPONENT: 
	1.component : header,footer,sidebar,section,division called component 
	2.props	: we pass them as a agrument to pass the data throught them they used to managed the data
	3.state	: it reloads only perticular tab or section when user intract with web-pages
	4.jsx	: javaScript Syntax extensions
	5.virtual dom	: copy of real dom

: So, DOM is real docuemnt where the all the changes saved it's a original page 
:     Virtual DOM : is copy of Real-DOM 
:     whrer, virtual dom it's appers for the thired party user or custormer where if user save there information in 
		perticular section/component then he/she only interact with virtual dom not directly real dom 
		hence, in that process only perticular section or component will get reload and not entire web_page 
		and after whatever changes are done that get saved on real dom this makes the our website faster than
		others, hence... using virtual dom it's makes our website faster...




*virtual dom:
-VDOM is the virtual representation of Real DOM
-React update the state changes in Virtual DOM first and then it syncs with Real DOM
-Virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine, can do the changes in the blueprint but those changes will not directly apply to the machine.
-Virtual DOM is a programming concept where a virtual representation of a UI is kept in memory synced with “Real DOM ” by a -library such as ReactDOM and this process is called reconciliation
-Virtual DOM makes the performance faster, not because the processing itself is done in less time. The reason is the amount of changed information – rather than wasting time on updating the entire page, you can dissect it into small elements and interactions
